# BioPortal-to-KGX

Assemble a BioPortal Knowledge Graph through the following steps:

* Transform the BioPortal 4store data dump to KGX graphs, with ROBOT preprocessing
* Validate the output graphs with KGX to determine alignment to the Biolink Model
* Obtain additional ontology metadata through the Bioportal API
* Retrieve mappings for nodes without clear Bioportal analogues through Bioportal
